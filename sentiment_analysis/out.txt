What did you want included in this purchase order?
 We’re going to need 10.000 of your Model X controllers by July 15.
 Ok, at that quantity, I can quote you $10 per unit but I don’t think we can deliver until July 30.
 That’s not going to work. We really need them by the 15th.
 Why so soon? We usually don’t deliver that quickly.
 We had a customer surprise us with an order we didn’t expect. And it’s really important that we get them to him on time.
 What if we were willing to pay $11 per unit? Could you bump us up in your priority so we get them sooner?
 I’m not sure that would do it. 
 I could go as high as $12 per unit.
 I’d have to check with engineering to see if they can meet that date.
 Please do that. I really don’t want to have to find another supplier. We’ve been happy with the Model X.
 Ok, let’s proceed with $12 per unit but I will need approval to finalize this deal, ok?
 Tomorrow?
 That works. Please get back to me then.
