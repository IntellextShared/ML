What did you want included in this purchase order?
We’re going to need 10.000 of your Model X controllers by July 15.
Ok, at that quantity, I can quote you $10 per unit . 
 but i don’t think we can deliver until july 30.
That’s not going to work. We really need them by the 15th.
Why so soon? We usually don’t deliver that quickly.
We had a customer surprise us with an order we didn’t expect. it’s really important that we get them to him on time.
What if we were willing to pay $11 per unit? Could you bump us up in your priority so we get them sooner?
I’m not sure that would do it.
I could go as high as $12 per unit.
I’d have to check with engineering . 
 to see if they can meet that date.
Please do that. I really don’t want to have to find another supplier. We’ve been happy with the Model X.
Ok, let’s proceed with $12 per unit . 
 but i will need approval to finalize this deal, ok?
How soon can you do that?
Tomorrow?
That works. Please get back to me then.
